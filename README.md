This repository has the code and data of a research project with the objective of developing a machine learning algorithm that can predict the bandgap of perovskite materials using computational techniques for the acceleration of material discovery. It is combined with machine learning classification and predictions along with Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations, which offer robust comparison to validate the accuracy of the ML models. The research allows designing perovskite materials for photovoltaic devices, among other applications, by accurately predicting the bandgap, thus eliminating extensive physical experimentation. A collection of files is provided with this repository: `INCAR`, `KPOINTS`, `FERMI_ENERGY`, and `BAND_GAP` for DFT calculations, a dataset (`MaterialsProject_Perovskite_data.csv`) used in training the ML model, and a Jupyter notebook (`ml_pero.ipynb`) implementing the ML algorithm, with detailed structural data in `Perovskite_CsNbO3_Bulk.ods`. This approach combines the strengths of ML and DFT to expedite the discovery of materials with desirable properties while ensuring reliability and precision in the predictions.
